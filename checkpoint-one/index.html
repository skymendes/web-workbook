            Why We Started
        </h3>
        Brown Sugar Bakery is a lifelong dream that I've had since I was four years old. Stemming from my grandfather, I was born into a family of chefs. I remember being 12 and instead of planning on what I would get for Christmas, I would be planning dessert menus. I finally decided to turn my dream into reality in the spring of 2016.
